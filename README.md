# py-cube

## About

`py-cube` is a package to build and publish cubes as defined by [cube.link](https://cube.link), describing a schema to describe structured data from tables in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/). It allows for an alternative to the [Cube-Creator](https://cube-creator.lindas.admin.ch). Currently this project is heavily linked to the [LINDAS](lindas.admin.ch) the Swiss Federal Linked Data Service.
